      <description>I have been reading a lot more after I left my previous job at NortonLifeLock as an SRE. It is nice to catch up with all the technology and tools that I was not using before.

Moreover, I still felt like after all these years I have not been sharing much of my thoughts and experiences with anyone other than close friends and family.</description>
